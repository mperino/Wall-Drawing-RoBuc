# Wall Drawing RoBuc

For Crescendo, I want to make a wall drawing robot that is capable of using both a marker and a spray can to make art live.  3D printed, read from SD card, powerfull steppers, stepper based pen (not servo) and with LED status lights to tell what color marker to load next.  My implementation is based on Fumik Robot, with a re-design of the Robot platform.  First Version will be a modified version of the Fumik code, with later versions being a complete re-write.


The orignal Fumik code and instructions:

Fumik Arduino code for robot is at: https://github.com/fumikrobot/source-code/blob/main/fumik_rv9.ino

<u><b> How to start a picture: </b></u>
<br/>
3.1 Your Picture need to draw

3.2 Convert picture to vector (*.svg file) by CorelDraw (or any other software support *.svg file)
<br/>
(see sample file test.cdr -> test.svg at https://github.com/fumikrobot/source-code/tree/main/draw%20file%20prepare)

3.3 Convert vector file to code for Arduino (by MS Excel, download at https://github.com/fumikrobot/source-code/blob/main/draw%20file%20prepare/SVG%20code%20extract.xlsm)

3.4 Copy code file to SD card
(sample file draw.txt at https://github.com/fumikrobot/source-code/blob/main/draw%20file%20prepare/draw.txt)

3.5 Plug in SD card to robot and start drawing
